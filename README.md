# Diabetes-Detection-using-SVM

Diabetes Prediction Project
Purpose: Developed a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on various health parameters. The goal was to create an accurate predictive tool to aid in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

Tech Stack Used:
Libraries: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn
Algorithm: Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel

Results:
Achieved an accuracy score of approximately 77.27% on the test dataset.
Successfully implemented data preprocessing and feature standardization to enhance model performance.
Ensured balanced sensitivity and specificity through comprehensive model evaluation.
